    <h2>Problem & Motivation</h2>
    <h3>The Hidden Danger in Our Waterways</h3>
    <p>
      Across the Southern United States, thousands of ponds, canals, and retention basins provide
      ideal habitats for alligators. These waterways are embedded in golf courses, parks, and
      residential neighborhoods—places where people routinely walk, jog, and recreate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alligators are masters of concealment, often remaining partially submerged or hidden during
      low-visibility conditions (especially at dusk and dawn). Their cryptic nature makes detection
      nearly impossible until it is too late.
    </p>

    <h4>Cryptic Nature</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Alligators blend seamlessly with water surfaces, logs, and vegetation.</li>
      <li>They exploit shadows, reflections, and murky water to stay hidden.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>High-Risk Areas</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>People and pets frequently walk close to shorelines.</li>
      <li>Golfers, pedestrians, children, and dog walkers are often within a few feet of the water’s edge.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>No Current Scalable Solution</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No widely deployed, automated system exists today for real-time alligator detection.</li>
      <li>Communities rely heavily on manual observation and occasional patrols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Human Safety Risk: Data Behind the Danger</h3>
    <p>
      Florida records numerous alligator attacks annually, with several resulting in fatalities.
      Many incidents occur within just 10 feet of water edges, where humans and alligators intersect
      most frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delayed recognition is the critical factor in preventable accidents: when an alligator is
      noticed too late, escape options disappear quickly.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Current Solutions Fall Short</h3>
    <h4>Manual Patrol Limitations</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Manual patrols cannot provide 24/7 coverage across hundreds of waterways.</li>
      <li>Staffing constraints create gaps during high-risk periods like dawn and dusk.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Visual Detection Failures</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Even trained personnel struggle to see alligators hidden in shadows and vegetation.</li>
      <li>Camouflage and partial submersion make reliable detection extremely challenging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>The Critical Gap</h4>
    <p>
      Communities need a scalable, continuous, real-time detection system that never sleeps,
      never blinks, and monitors every water edge simultaneously with consistent vigilance.

    <h2>Technical Approach (AlexNet-Based CNN)</h2>
    <h3>Project Mission</h3>
    <p>
      ReptileRisk AI transforms passive water monitoring into continuous,
      active threat detection. The goal is to provide communities with automated vigilance that
      helps prevent dangerous encounters before they happen.
    </p>

    <h3>System Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring:</strong> Strategically placed cameras and drones capture video streams around waterways.</li>
      <li><strong>Edge AI Processing:</strong> Frames are processed by an on-site or nearby AI engine for low-latency inference.</li>
      <li><strong>Instant Alerts:</strong> Mobile notifications, dashboard alerts, and smart signage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AlexNet Architecture</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Convolutional Layers (1–5)</strong> – Detect edges to complex reptile features.</li>
      <li><strong>Max Pooling</strong> – Reduces dimensions while preserving features.</li>
      <li><strong>Fully Connected Layers</strong> – High-level classification features.</li>
      <li><strong>Softmax Output</strong> – Probability scores for alligator presence.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Data Input & Preprocessing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>224×224 RGB input images</li>
      <li>Sources: Cameras and drones</li>
      <li>Glare reduction and normalization</li>
      <li>Data augmentation: flips, rotations, brightness/contrast</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Model Training</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>80% training / 20% validation</li>
      <li>Loss: Cross-entropy</li>
      <li>Optimizer: Adam</li>
      <li>Learning Rate: 0.001</li>
      <li>Epochs: 5</li>
      <li>Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score</li>
    </ul>
